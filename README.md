# browser-using-agent

## Overview
LumiTeh functions in a way similar to a standard computer-use completion system. At its core, LumiTeh analyzes both a screenshot and the DOM elements of a browser interface, then generates an action that can be seamlessly executed by any browser driver.

## Abstractions
This repository introduces two lightweight abstractions designed to make working with LumiTeh agents more straightforward. While LumiTeh can operate without them, these abstractions provide a clean separation of responsibilities and improve usability.

| Abstraction | File                  | Description |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Browser     | computers/computer.py | Defines a Browser interface adaptable to multiple environments (local desktop, remote browser, etc.). A Browser implementation is responsible for executing any browser_action generated by LumiTeh (such as clicks). Any compatible computer can implement this interface to ensure interoperability. |
| Agent       | agent/agent.py        | Provides a simple agent loop â€“ implements `run_full_turn()`, which repeatedly calls the model until all browser actions and function calls are processed. |
